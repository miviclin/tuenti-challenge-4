# Tuenti Programming Challenge 4

_From April 28th to May 5th 2014_

These are my solutions for some of the [challenges of the contest](https://contest.tuenti.net/Challenges). All these solutions together have been developed in under a week, so they may not be the optimal solutions for the problems they try to solve. And the readability of some parts of the code could be improved too.

### List of provided solutions
- **Challenge 01:** Anonymous Poll
- **Challenge 02:** F1 - Bird's-eye Circuit
- **Challenge 03:** The Gambler’s Club - Monkey Island 2
- **Challenge 04:** Shape shifters
- **Challenge 05:** Tribblemaker
- **Challenge 06:** Man in the middle
- **Challenge 07:** Yes we scan
- **Challenge 08:** Tuenti Restructuration
- **Challenge 09:** Bendito Caos
- **Challenge 12:** Taxi Driver
- **Challenge 14:** Train Empire

### Notes
- **Challenge 08:** Tuenti Restructuration 
 - _Not all tests pass. I ended up skipping this one._
